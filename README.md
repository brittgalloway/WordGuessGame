This is a Word Guessing Game made with Javascript.<br>
The theme is DreamWorks movie titles.<br>
To press "enter" to start.<br>
A series of \_ will appear and you can begin to guess letters.<br>
I could not get the spaces between words to read as spaces. I suggest filling out the letters, then pressing space bar. Assuming you have more than 0 guesses remaining, the game will recognize that you have finished the word and increase the score by 1.<br>
Press Enter to guess another movie title.<br>
After each attempted word, the remaining guesses return to 5.<br>
If you win 11 times consecutively you beat the game.<br>
