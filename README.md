This is a Word Guessing Game.
The theme is DreamWorks movie titles.
To press "enter" to start.
A series of \_ will appear and you can begin to guess letters.
I could not get the spaces between words to read as spaces. I suggest filling out the letters, then pressing space bar. Assuming you have more than 0 guesses remaining, the game will recognize that you have finished the word and increase the score by 1.
Press Enter to guess another movie title.
After each attempted word, the remaining guesses return to 5.
If you win 11 times consecutively you beat the game.
